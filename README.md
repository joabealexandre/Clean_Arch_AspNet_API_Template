# Clean Arch API

This is my Clean Architecure API with ASP.NET Core template.

In this project we are using:

- .NET 8
- EF Core


#### VS Code Extensions Required
- [C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)


### Running the project

After opening the project in VS Code you should see a popup alert from the C# extension with the message - Required assets to build and debug are missing from 'MyWebApp'. Add them? - click Yes to automatically generate the launch.json and tasks.json files in the .vscode folder with the required configuration to build and debug the project.

Alternatively you can generate the `tasks.json` and `launch.json` files with these steps:

- Select Run and Debug on the side bar (or press Ctrl + Shift + D)
- Click create a launch.json file
- Select environment: .NET Core

**Launch the app in debug mode by selecting Run -> Start Debugging (or by pressing F5).**
